This major version integrates the Whisper speech recognition model published by OpenAI. It also introduces some breaking changes to remove deprecated usages and simplify some modules.

### Breaking changes

#### General

* Implement the Conv1D layer and operator on CPU and GPU (using oneDNN and cuDNN respectively)
